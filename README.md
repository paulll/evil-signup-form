Despite the small size of the project, it utilizes big amount of different cloud solutions, libraries, build-systems, preprocessors, etc.
So, this is a simple example of somewhat full-featured cloud-native application. 

- `stylus` - css preprocessor
- `pug` - html template engine
- `gulp` - node.js build system
- `travis-ci` - continious integration
- `github pages` - static site hosting
- `serverless` - serverless applications framework
- `aws lambda` - serverless cloud provider
- `postgresql` - dbms (elephantsql sql-as-a-service is used in example)
